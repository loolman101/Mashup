Boyfriend-scar: Hey!!! Hey!
Theo-bruh: The fu-? What do you want?
Boyfriend-norm: Okay look, I know this is going to sound crazy, 
Boyfriend-norm: but were being held captive and forced to rap battle for a crowd's amusement. 
Boyfriend-norm:This could all be over a lot quicker if you just compete with us in a rap battle.
Calliope-norm: Ill vouch for him, sir. He's telling the truth.
Theo-kill: Sir? We'll I must say, I'm flattered BAHAHAHAH. 
Theo-norm: But seriously, who the fuck are you two? No I'm not going to rap battle you both. 
Theo-norm: Can't you see I have more important things to do then to waste my time with your petty excuse for music. 
Theo-norm: If you both value your lives I suggest you leave. And quickly too. 
Calliope-distress: Please there has to be something we can do. 
Boyfriend-scar: Yeah, we'll do anything!
Theo-kill: Anything? Interesting. 
Theo-sigh: Hmm... uhh.. Do either of you have any powers? Considering you both just came from a portal.
Calliope-shy: I can fly. 
Theo-bruh: Boring. 
Boyfriend-sad: I was able to woo over my girls dad by singing..!
Theo-kill: You can solve conflict by singing? Hmm, that could actually be useful. 
Theo-bruh: I have this um... problem. Why don't you stay til' nighttime and see if you can um, sing at the thing.  
Boyfriend-scar: Sure we can do that. Right Calliope? 
Calliope-norm: Uh, yeah sure, of course we can. 
Calliope-norm: But the agreement is that you gotta sing with us. 
Theo-sigh: ...
Theo-sigh: Fine.. 
Theo-norm: Id like to warn you though, im not the best singer.
