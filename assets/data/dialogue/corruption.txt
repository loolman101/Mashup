Theo-bruh: How many songs am I supposed to sing? 
Calliope-norm: 3. 
Theo-kill: Perfect. Let's get this final song over with. 
Boyfriend-giggle: Just the way I like my opponents, less talk and more action!
Calliope-distress: That was the cheesiest thing I've ever heard Boyfriend.
Boyfriend-giggle: Get used to it because there's gonna be plenty more cheesy bullshit coming from this mouth!
Theo-pissed: Are we gonna fucking sing? We don't have all day. You both literally only have till night time. 
Boyfriend-panic: Sorry.
