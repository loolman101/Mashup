Boyfriend-giggle: That was fun. 
Calliope-shy: Not for me.. This guy scares me. 
Theo-bruh: You try being cooped up in a twisted cult 24/7 and stay sane.
Theo-sigh: I've been stuck like this for a while. And I am not missing out on the opportunity to finally be able to live a normal life. 
Theo-norm: So lay it on me. I'll sing however much I have too. 
Calliope-norm: What do you mean you want to live a normal life?
Theo-norm: It's better if I keep it to myself, because if you guys find out what it is. You're not going to help me. 
Boyfriend-norm: We said we'd do anything. We meant that. 
Theo-bruh: Trust me. If you guys figure it out, you'll regret ever making this agreement. 
Theo-sigh: The only way this is gonna work is if you don't know what you're dealing with. 
Calliope-pissed: Why? 
Calliope-pissed: That would give us enough time to come up with a plan. 
Theo-bruh: Because you won't be spending your time having to be anxious and scared. 
Calliope-pissed: Damn it, please just tell us. 
Calliope-pissed: We literally came from a portal, we've never been in this dimension before in our lives. 
Calliope-pissed: We have no idea how anything works in your world. 
Calliope-pissed: We need some semblance of closure.
Theo-sigh: *sigh*
Theo-norm: Are you sure you both can handle the truth?
Boyfriend-norm: Yes we can. 
Theo-norm: You both promise you won't leave? 
Boyfriend-scar: Even if we wanted to leave we couldn't. 
Theo-norm: Okay, look. You're going to sing at what is basically a monster. 
Boyfriend-sad: A monster isn't that big of a deal. 
Theo-pissed: Let me finish. 
Theo-bruh: A crazy psychotic, deranged, serial killer of a monster. That attacks at first sight. 
Theo-norm: In other words. Your lives are at stake. 
Boyfriend-norm: Oh, I've sort of dealt with that already. Some weird lemon thing keeps stalking me and my girlfriend.
Theo-bruh:...
Boyfriend-scar: What?
Theo-norm: ...Nothing. If you guys are going to come up with a plan, now would be a good idea. 
Calliope-norm: Boyfriend can you come over here for a second so we can discuss what we're going to do? 
Boyfriend-norm: Sure.
Calliope-shy: Okay, Boyfriend. I need you to be honest with me. By chance can you actually stop conflict by singing?
Boyfriend-bruh: No...
Calliope-shy: Okay, we need to figure out how we're going to defeat this thing. 
Calliope-pissed: Those guys probably want us to sing against that thing. Then we can move on with the challenge.
Calliope-confident: That has to be it. Why else would they throw us in with this cult dude?! They want to entertain their viewers. 
Boyfriend-scar: You do have a point, it feels like this entire day has been building up to something. 
Calliope-norm: And considering how an audience is viewing this, what would make more sense then to build up to the monster. 
Calliope-confident: I bet the second we beat that thing in a rap battle the portal will open and we can jump in. 
Boyfriend-scar: So we're not gonna be able to save Theo?
Calliope-shy: No. But we will be able to get out of here. We gotta do what's best for ourselves. 
Calliope-scar: We have family and friends we need to return too. 
Boyfriend-panic: My girlfriend is probably worried sick right now. 
Calliope-pissed: Exactly, more the reason to follow through with this plan.
Boyfriend-norm: Theo, we're ready to compete. 
Theo-norm: Okay..
